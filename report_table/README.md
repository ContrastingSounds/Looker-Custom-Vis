# Report Table

Intended to become a flexible table for producing printed reports. Goals / constraints include:

- Print nicely
- Single page output only (i.e. only so many rows & columns)
- Make it easy to do variances etc
- Format like a financial report
- Flexibility on sub-totals and running totals (e.g. easy to add rows, set orders)
- Limited data volume (e.g. 100 rows, 100 columns) => performance optimisation not required
- Minimal interactivity
