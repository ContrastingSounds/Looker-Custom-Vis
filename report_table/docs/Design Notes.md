### Tasks

- Build a list of all columns in data
- Create a 'semi-flat table' i.e. array of row objects, each of which has an array of cell objects
- Display that as a table
- Enrich the table object
  - Add the total row
  - Add the subtotal rows
  - Have a single dimension column, appropriately indented for line items / subtotals / totals
  - Have a single dimension column, appropriately bolded/capitalised for line items / subtotals / totals
  - Colspans for pivots
  - Option to put total at top or bottom
  - Option to put subtotals above or below rows
  - Ability to hide rows associated with a given subtotal
- Formatting
  - Red for negatives
  - Brackets for negatives
  - Bold top border for subtotals
  - Top & bottom border for totals
  - Up/down/steady bullets ( △ ▽ ▷ )
- Calculations
  - Variance:
    - Any column with a numeric column to left has config options for Absolute Var, Relative Var
    - Any pivoted set of columns has config option to create a "Variance Pivot Group"
  - Top N + Others, with option to add sub-total of the Top N
    - Initial requirement is a single dimension table i.e. simple calc with limit of N plus Totals enabled
  - Arbitrary re-grouping as supplementary information / rows below the total
    - If this means having a dimension used purely for re-grouping, might take a healthy chunk of data re-processing. It's not possible to "hide from vis" and still have access to the values. Which means they must be present and impacting any existing sub-totals
